*YouTube Audio Streamer*

A lightweight Flask application that streams audio (MP3) from the most recent uploaded video of selected YouTube channels using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.

This project is ideal for creating low-bandwidth audio streams from YouTube content â€” particularly useful for older devices (like Symbian phones with CorePlayer) or embedded use-cases.

Example

If you have a channel like:

"skicr": "https://www.youtube.com/@skicrtv/videos"

Then this will be accessible via:

http://your-server/skicr.mp3

The app will serve the MP3 stream from the most recently uploaded video on that channel.
